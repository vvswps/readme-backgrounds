# readme-backgrounds
Add custom backgrounds to the readme.md file on your repos


## Theory

Interface that lets people add stuff on a webpage
Instead of an interface maybe add an api call like other badges etc
Users can put badges and gifs on the webpage
The background image property can be set to allow placing of elements on top
Provide options to reorder elements etc

Can also do something like
A user will only have to submit their current readme and choose a bg
The program will automatically place the elements in the way they had been placed before 

I can see this might not be a popular project
But I wanna make it nonetheless 

Then take a ss of the page and export it as a image in the repo
The image will update daily
Once created for a user it’ll be autogenerated everyday

If possible use the picture tag and specify different images with different alignments as the screen size decreases 
This’ll make it accessible 
If not able to do this
Just say whoever the f uses GitHub on other devices
